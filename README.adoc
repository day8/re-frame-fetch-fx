== js/Fetch Effect Handler for re-frame

This re-frame library contains an
https://github.com/superstructor/re-frame/blob/develop/docs/Effects.md[Effect Handler]
for fetching resources.

Keyed `:fetch`, it wraps browsers' native
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch[`js/fetch` API].

== Quick Start

=== Step 1. Add Dependency

Add the following project dependency:
image:https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/superstructor/re-frame-fetch-fx?style=for-the-badge&logo=clojure&logoColor=fff["Clojars Project", link="https://clojars.org/superstructor/re-frame-fetch-fx"]

Requires re-frame >= 0.8.0.

=== Step 2. Registration and Use

In the namespace where you register your event handlers, prehaps called
`events.cljs`, you have two things to do.

*First*, add this require to the `ns`:

```
(ns app.events
  (:require
   ...
   [superstructor.re-frame.fetch-fx]
   ...))
```

Because we never subsequently use this require, it appears redundant. But its
existence will cause the `:fetch` effect handler to self-register with re-frame,
which is important to everything that follows.

*Second*, write an event handler which uses this effect:

```
(reg-event-fx
  :handler-with-fetch
  (fn [{:keys [db]} _]
    {:fetch {:method                 :get
             :url                    "https://api.github.com/orgs/day8"
             :mode                   :cors
             :timeout                5000
             :response-content-types {#"application/.*json" :json}
             :on-success             [:good-fetch-result]
             :on-failure             [:bad-fetch-result]}}))
```

== Request Content Type

With the exception of JSON there is no special handling of the `:body` value or
the request's `Content-Type` header. So for anything except JSON you *must*
handle that yourself.

For convenience for JSON requests `:request-content-type :json` is supported
which will:

* set the `Content-Type` header of the request to `application/json`
* evaluate `clj->js` on the `:body` then `js/JSON.stringify` it.

== Response Content Types

`:response-content-type` is a mapping of pattern or string to a keyword
representing one of the following processing models in Table 1.

The pattern or string will be matched against the response
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type[`Content-Type` header]
then the associated keyword is used to determine the processing model and result
type.

In the absence of a response `Content-Type` header the value that is matched
against will default to `text/plain`.

In the absence of a match the processing model will default to `:text`.

.Response Content Types
[options="header,footer"]
|========================
| Keyword | Processing | Result Type
| `:json` | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Body/json[`json()`] then `js->clj :keywordize-keys true`| ClojureScript
| `:text` | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Body/text[`text()`] | String
| `:form-data` | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData[`formData()`] | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData[`js/FormData`]
| `:blob` | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Body/blob[`blob()`] | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob[`js/Blob`]
| `:array-buffer` | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Body/arrayBuffer[`arrayBuffer()`] | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer[`js/ArrayBuffer`]

             ;; See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity
             :integrity              "sha256-BpfBw7ivV8q2jLiT13fxDYAe2tJllusRSZ273h2nFSE="

             :timeout                5000

             :response-content-types {#"application/.*json"      :json
                                      "text/plain"               :text
                                      "multipart/form-data"      :form-data

                                      "application/octet-stream" :array-buffer}

             ;; Optional. If you want to associate multiple requests with a single
             ;; AbortSignal you can pass it as value for the :abort-signal and use your own
             ;; (external) AbortController to handle aborts.
             :abort-signal            (.-signal (js/AbortController)

             ;; Use :request-id with ::abort effect to abort the request
             ;; Note: when using :abort-signal you cannot abort the request using :request-id
             :request-id             :my-custom-request-id
             ;; or auto-generated
             :on-request-id          [:fetch-request-id]

             :on-success             [:good-fetch-result]

             :on-failure             [:bad-fetch-result]}}))
```

== Aborting Requests
There are two different ways you can abort requests:

 * Abort a (single) request by passing its **request-id** to the `::abort` effect:
```
(reg-event-fx
  :abort-request
  (fn [_ [request-id]]
    {::abort {:request-id request-id}}))
```
**Note:** Reusing the same request-id for multiple different requests **will not work**.
          The `::abort` effect would only abort the last of these requests.

* Abort multiple requests by using an external **AbortController**. Pass the AbortController's  **AbortSignal** instance
as value for the `:abort-signal` inside the `::fetch` effect map.

**Note**: When you decide to use an external AbortController by passing its `:abort-signal`
          in the `::fetch` map, you **cannot** abort this request via the `::abort` effect anymore.

== Success Handling

`:on-success` is dispatched with a response map like:

```
{:url         "http://localhost..."
 :ok?         true
 :redirected? false
 :status      200
 :status-text "OK"
 :type        "cors"
 :final-uri?  nil
 :body        "Hello World!"
 :headers     {:cache-control "private, max-age=0, no-cache" ...}}
```

Note the type of `:body` changes drastically depending on both the provided
`:response-content-types` map *and* the response's `Content-Type` header.

== Failure Handling

=== Problems with no Response

Unfortunately for cases where there is no server response the `js/fetch` API
provides terribly little information that can be captured programatically. If
`:on-failure` is dispatched with a response like:
```
{:problem         :fetch
 :problem-message "Failed to fetch"}
```

Then it may be caused by any of the following or something else not included here:

* `:url` syntax error
* unresolvable hostname in `:url`
* no network connection
* Content Security Policy
* Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Policy or lacking `:mode :cors`

Look in the Chrome Developer Tools console. There is usually a useful error
message indicating the problem but so far I have not found out how to capture it
to provide more fine grained `:problem` keywords.

=== Problem due to Timeout

If `:timeout` is exceeded, `:on-failure` will be dispatched with a response like:

```
{:problem         :timeout
 :problem-message "Fetch timed out"}
```

=== Problems Reading the Response Body

If there is a problem reading the body after the server has responded, such as
a JSON syntax error, `:on-failure` will be dispatched with a response like:
```
{:problem         :body
 :reader          :json
 :problem-message "Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0"
 ... rest of normal response map excluding :body ... }
```

=== Problems with the Server

If the server responds with an unsuccessful HTTP status code, such as 500 or 404,
`:on-failure` will be dispatched with a response like:
```
{:problem :server
 ... rest of normal response map ... }
```

== Differences to `:http-xhrio`

=== `:uri` Renamed to `:url`

Previously with `:http-xhrio` it was keyed `:uri`.

Now with `:fetch` we follow the
https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/[Fetch Standard] nomenclature so it is keyed
`:url`.

=== `:params` != `:body`

Previously with `:http-xhrio` URL parameters and the request body were both
keyed as `:params`. Which one it was depended on the `:method` (i.e. GET would
result in URL parameters whereas POST would result in a request body).

Now with `:fetch` there are two keys.

`:params` is *only* URL parameters. It will always be added to the URL regardless
of `:method`.

`:body` is the request body. In practice it is only supported for `:put`, `:post`
and `:patch` methods. Theoretically HTTP request bodies are allowed for all
methods except `:trace`, but just don't as there be dragons.

=== No `:request-format` or `:response-format`

This has completely changed in every way including the keys used, how to specify
the handling of the response body and the types of values used for the response
body. See <<Request Content Type>> and <<Response Content Types>>.

=== Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Previously with `:http-xhrio`
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS[CORS] requests would
'just work'.

Now with `:fetch` `:mode :cors` *must* be set explicitly as the default mode for
`js/fetch` is `:same-origin` which blocks CORS requests.
